''' A* algorithm: the following algorithm uses two main types of data structures: lists and dictionaries.

1. A list of 8 possible directions is created: up, down, left, right, diagonally up to the right, 
diagonally down to the right, diagonally up to the left and finally diagonally down to the left.

2. A closed list that will store the visited positions that do not have to be considered a second time.

3. An open list containing all the visited positions that are retained.

4. A dictionary containing all the parent positions of each "current" position respectfully.

5. A cumulative g value.

6. A cumulative f value based on the cost (g value) and the heuristic value.

7. Logic of the restrictions: to determine the colour of the current and adjacent squares, 
we compare their values to the chosen threshold. In other words, if the value at any position is greater than the 
threshold, then it is a high crime area and the colour is deduced to be yellow and vice-versa.

Additional comments are provided in the function below.'''
